# Templates

## Introduction

Templates are files that store tree information. They're the key to the Isle ecosystem, as they define the structure of the hierarchy tree, and the behavior of the applications that run in that tree. They define the dynamism of the ecosystem, and they make sure each application running in one branch is isolated from each other. Every asset that will be directly injected in the hierarchy tree must be a template.
