# Modules

## Introduction

Modules are the behavior that is applied to nodes. They're the way to add interactivity to the ecosystem, and they're the way to make the ecosystem come to life. They're the way to make the ecosystem flexible and extensible. The API provides a big portion of them, but custom ones can be added by using the scripting API. They can also interact with each other to create more complex behaviors.
