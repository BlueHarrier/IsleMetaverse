# Avatars

## Introduction

Based on previous implementations of the metaverse, such as Resonite and VRChat, avatars are the interface between the user and the ecosystem. They are the representation of the user in the isle, and they can be anything that you can imagine. Avatars can be humanoid creatures, animals, or even objects, and can be controlled by the user. Though, the way they interact is a thing of two. While the avatar sets the appearance, toys, and gadgets that they want, the movement of the user through the world is define by this entity, as malicious avatars could easily mess with the other user's experience. Hence, worlds can set up movement rules, as well as size (scale) restrictions, tag restrictions, and even the ability to interact with other avatars. This is done to prevent griefing, and to keep the ecosystem safe.

## Shifting avatars

An avatar shift is the process of changing the avatar. If the established avatar is valid, while it downloads, the user can still move and interact normally, but if the avatar is invalid, the gateway will request the server to give them a default avatar, and the user will be stuck in the void until the avatar is downloaded. If this change is smooth, the user won't even notice their short stay in the void.

## Unbound avatars

An avatar that is not being used by any user, but is summoned in the world, can be called "unbound". These avatars can be picked up and clone by users, and even being used as NPCs, or even another special and unique way to interact with world, just saying ðŸ‘€. This is useful to share avatars with other users by summoning them into the world, without shifting your own.

## Unbound users

In the other hand, if a user doesn't have an avatar, what happens? Avatars are the interface with the ecosystem, so a user simply cannot exist without an avatar. In that case, the gateway must request the server to give them an avatar. This avatar can be a default one, or even a random one, but it must be an avatar. In the meantime, the user can chill out in the void, or something.
