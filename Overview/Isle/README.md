# Isles

## Introduction

Isles give the name to the project. They're the servers, the hosts that users can connect to. They're the instances of the ecosystem, either public or private, that connect the people in the metaverse. Anyone can host an Isle, and make their own rules, restrictions, login requirements, etc. They can also be mounted alongside a web server, and a content server, which gives them the ability to store all the resources needed to run static or user-made applications.
