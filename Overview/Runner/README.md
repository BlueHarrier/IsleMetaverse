# Runner

## Introduction

Runners are the applications that run the metaverse. They're the way users connect to the ecosystem, and they're the way they interact with it. Runners are the clients of the ecosystem, and they're the ones that make the ecosystem come to life, in conjunction with the isles. They can be compared to how web browsers display websites, well, these can display worlds, avatars, and artifacts.
