# Artifacts

Artifacts are templates that can be spawned by users, and may be interactable. There's really no class that controls the artifacts, as they're just simple pieces of ecosystem, so effectively, worlds and avatars can be artifacts as well. The user owner of said artifact is kept, so they can always remove them if they want, doesn't matter where is it in the tree. As avatars are templates, and so, isolated, they can always communicate with messages and triggers.
