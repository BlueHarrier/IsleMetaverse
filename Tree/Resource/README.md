# Resource (interface)

## Overview

Resources are assets that are either imported, or generated by the API. These resources are used by the modules and singletons in the tree to play audio, fetch images and textures, render meshes, etc. In order to load them in the tree, resources are always embedded, but they can have a URI to the `Importer` object required.

| Property | Type | JSON | Script |
|----------|------|------|--------|
| `import` | `String` | Yes, not required | Yes |
| `settings` | `Object` | | Yes, not required | Yes |

## Property descriptions

### `String` import

The URI to the resource importer that this Resource must be generated from. In the case of the resource not being in a repository, therefore not having an importer, it is possible to specify the importer at the beginning of the URI: `PNGImporter@https://domain.mine/path/to/image.png`.

### `Object` settings

When used in conjunction with `import`, it will override any setting set on the original import, effectively making a duplicate of it, or define new import settings if the importer has been specified.

> [!TIP]
> If creating a duplicate instance of the original import is intended, but no alteration to the settings is required, it's possible to define this parameter, but leave it blank: `"settings": { }`.
